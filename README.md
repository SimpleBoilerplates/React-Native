# Boilerplates

This is a very simple Boilerplate application, this has following features.

  - User can Sign In and Up
  - After signing in he can see a list of items
  
  * I didn't add many functionality and didn't polish UI intentionally, tried to keep it barebone as much as possible 
  
  ### Same implementation in other platforms
   - [Android](https://github.com/simpleboilerplates/BooksDemoAndroid) 
   - [iOS](https://github.com/simpleboilerplates/BooksDemoiOS) 
   - [NodeJS backend](https://github.com/simpleboilerplates/BooksDemoNode) 


### TODO
- Updating it on daily basis as much as possible, work in progess[WIP].
